Hi i'm Ashley Wanjiku 
I'm interested in floral work
I'm currently learning different types of flowers and their purposes.
i am looking to collaborate on a project to predict customers likeliness on buying certain variety of flowers on certain occations.
You can reach me through email @wambuiash4@gmjail.com or through facebook @wambuiwanjiku.
Fun fact; I've grown up in a family of florists and i ended up taking a passion in the area. I've learned about almost 50 different types of flowers, what conditions they grow in best, what people use them for and the way the flower market works.
I am from Kenya where flowers is among the largest horticilture export.
